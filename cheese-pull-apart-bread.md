Ingredients
===========

- 2 dl milk
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 30 g yeast
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 55 g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 375 g flour
- 35 g nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp Italian herb seasoning
- 1½ tsp salt

Filling
=======

- 55 g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- ¼ tsp salt
- 225 g shredded Parmesan cheese
- 225 g shredded cheddar cheese

Instructions
============

- Warm the milk to between 36 and 40 °C.
- In a large mixing bowl, whisk the warm milk with the sugar, yeast,
  eggs, and softened butter.
- Add the flour, nutritional yeast, Italian seasoning, and salt. Mix
  with a large wooden spoon until it forms a soft dough.
- Knead the dough by hand for about 5 minutes, until the dough is
  smooth and elastic. (Or knead the dough in a stand mixer with a hook
  attachment for about 3 minutes.)
- Place the dough ball back in the mixing bowl and cover it with a
  kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm spot until it has
  doubled in size, after about 1 hour.
- In a small bowl, mix the softened butter, garlic powder, and salt
  until it forms a thick paste. Set aside.
- Grease a 12 x 22 cm (2 l) loaf pan and set aside. Roll out the dough
  until it's about 30 by 40 cm. Spread the garlic butter over the
  dough in an even layer, all the way to the edges. Cut the dough into
  12 even squares (3 squares by 4 squares). Sprinkle the shredded
  Parmesan and cheddar evenly on top of each square.
- Fold each square of dough in half and place it in the prepared loaf
  pan so the folded side is facing down in the pan, and the open side
  showing the filling is facing up. To get all the dough pieces to
  fit, gently press the ones in the loaf pan towards the edge to make
  room for the rest.
- Cover the loaf pan with a kitchen towel. Set aside to proof for 1
  hour, until the loaf has puffed up. The dough is done proofing when
  an indent made by your finger springs back to its original shape
  after 2-3 seconds.
- Preheat the oven to 175°C. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until the loaf
  is golden brown and reaches an internal temperature of 88-93°C. I
  usually add a large piece of aluminum foil folded in half over my
  bread after 20 minutes, to prevent the top from getting too
  dark. Allow the loaf to cool for 10 minutes, then remove it from the
  loaf pan to tear & share!
- Optional: Brush the top with a little melted butter and sprinkle
  with fresh chopped herbs or extra shredded cheese.
